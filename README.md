## Contributing

Create an Issue with the road you want added

Issues that do not follow the submission rules in this readme risk being closed
The rules obviously can have exceptions


### Submission rules
- Only roads myself or trusted people are able to validate in person are considered, good quality videos can substitute for this rule if they can showcase the road well enough
- The submission must have some sort of path/track provided as a link or inline (use a route creator like google maps or maps.openrouteservice.org)
- Only European roads for now
